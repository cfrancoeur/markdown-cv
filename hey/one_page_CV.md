## Research Experience
### Current
**[Currie Lab](https://currielab.wisc.edu/), University of Wisconsin-Madison** `January 2017-Present`
>Graduate research assistant in the laboratory of Dr. Cameron Currie investigating bacterial and viral associations in fungus-farming ants (tribe: Attini). You can find more details about my research at cfrancoeur.github.io/research/  
### Past
**Wu Lab, University of Maryland - College Park** `September 2014 - July 2016`  
>Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research Laboratory  
>Volunteer undergraduate research assistant in the laboratory of Dr. Louisa Wu   
>Used the [Drosophila Genetics Research Panel](http://dgrp2.gnets.ncsu.edu/) to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find genes associated with the phagocytosis of fungi in *Drosophila melanogaster*   

**Nou Lab, USDA-ARS** `August 2012 - May 2014`  
>Biological Science Aid in the Environmental Microbial and Food Safety laboratory of Dr. Xiangwu Nou
